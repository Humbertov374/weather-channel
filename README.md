# Weather Channel
## Version 1.0.0
#

Hello and welcome to your personal weather channel! How does it work you may ask? It's quite simple, all you have to do is type in a city name (a valid name), press search and there ya go a 5 day weather report!
It includes the current day's weather stats (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the UV index) as well as the forecast for the next five days!
Also if you somehow forget the name of the city you looked up, no worries! All searched cities will be saved to the local storage!
So remember before you head out, use the weather channel, and you'll never forget your coat, umbrella, or sun screen ever again!
